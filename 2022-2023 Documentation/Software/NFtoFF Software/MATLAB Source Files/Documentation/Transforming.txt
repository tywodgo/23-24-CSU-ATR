About Transforming:
	Transforming a near-field radiation pattern into a far-field 
	radiation pattern is a complex process. It involves taking an
	entire surface integral of the near-field rectangular mesh, 
	and computing a single far-field point. This process is done
	repeatedly to produce a far-field mesh. 
 
	The continuous version of the integral is as shown below:
 
	EFF(r) = e^(-jk0r)/(4πr)∯{n’×[∇’×ENF(r’)]+jk0[n’× ENF(r’)]×ir}e^(jk0ir⋅r’)ds’
 
	The discretized version is as shown below: 
 
	EFF[r] = e^(-jk0r)/(4πr)Σ{n'×curl(ENF[r']) + jk0[n' ENF[r']]×ir}e^(jk0ir⋅r’)*(area of scan surface)
 
How to Transform:
	Simply select "t" from the list of options on the menu screen. Follow
	through with the prompts, and it will save the transform in your MATLAB
	Workspace. If you want to save the transformed data, you need to export it
	from your workspace.
