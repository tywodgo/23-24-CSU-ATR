----- Welcome to CSUATR -----
Before executing the CSUATR_####_##_##.exe program, copy the executable and the dlls into a separate folder together.
In this folder, run the executable.
Two folders will be created. These contain first versions of the project meta and settings.

The meta file will stay static, meaning that there can only one one of these and its name
will not change
