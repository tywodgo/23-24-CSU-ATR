			<h3><span>Electrical Engineer</span></h3>
				<h3><span><img src="images/Adam.jpg" width="361" height=auto> &nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Hulse</span></h3>
				<p>Adam is a senior undergraduate at Colorado State University studying electrical engineering with a strong focus in electromagnetics, especially in antennas and RF. A born and raised local to Fort Collins, he enjoys spending his free time in mountains or hanging out with his friends.
			<h3><span>Computer Engineer</span></h3>
				<h3><span><img src="images/Parker.jpg" width="407" height=auto>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker Segelhorst</span></h3>
				<p>Parker is a computer engineering major at Colorado State University with a strong interest in the mathematics related to linear systems & signals. He other interests are in microcontroller and IoT based at home projects, music, hiking, and reading.
			<h3><span>Computer Engineer</span></h3>
				<h3><span><img src="images/Josh.jpg" width="350" height=auto>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua Barber</span></h3>
				<p>My name is Josh Barber and I'm a Computer Engineer working on the CSU ATR. I am currently a Senior with a focus on VLSI design. I currently work in industrial controls but, want to work with radio frequency analysis in the future. Working with ATR I have been able to learn more about how antennas propagate waves and how we measure radiation patterns. I have also learned a lot more about various software we use for antenna analysis. As I continue working in this lab I hope to know the complete functionality of the ATR and what changes we can make in software to increase our scan precision.
			<h3><span>Mechanical Engineer</span></h3>
				<h3><span><img src="images/Owen.jpg" width="350" height=auto>&nbsp;&nbsp;Owen Dietrich</span></h3>
				<p>My name is Owen Dietrich, and I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Mechanical Engineering degree at Colorado State University. I appreciated contributing to a project where I can exercise my mechanical ability. Over the years I would spend my spare time restoring trucks and motorcycles while attending school in Monument Colorado. Growing up in Colorado, I developed an early appreciation for space. I frequently visited the Air Force Academy, toured the Kenny Space Center in Florida, and attended shows demonstrating current advanced aircraft technology. Now I currently work on a Bison Ranch through Colorado State University helping maintain and fix the equipment and machinery on the property and providing general animal care for the bison. I am excited to contribute to the Antenna Testing Range team at Colorado State University and further develop the project.
