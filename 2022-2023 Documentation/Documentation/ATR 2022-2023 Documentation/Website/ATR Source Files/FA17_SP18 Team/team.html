				<h3><img src="images/keenan.jpg" width="160" height="320" class="rotate90">&nbsp;&nbsp;Keenan Mallory</h3>
				<p>Electrical Engineering student studying the principals of RF and microwave theory. Current course work includes applied electromagnetics and telecommunications. A construction background leads to skills in developing systems that work mechanically and electrically. Enjoys rebuilding automotive four wheelers and motorcycles. Believes that a system of wireless power may eventually lead to a revolution that can create flying cars. Among other things, an intense love of nature has led to excursions to see the total eclipse of the sun near Bomber Lake while discovering the wreckage of a B-24 Bomber from World War II. The key to true knowledge is knowing you know nothing and always seeking for answers.</p>
